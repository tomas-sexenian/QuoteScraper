# System Design Documentation  
  
## 1. Approach Overview  
  
This scraper is designed to log in to [quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com/) and collect all quotes across paginated results. Each quote includes data like text, author, and tags. The scraper includes error handling, retry logic, and structured logging to ensure stability.
The project also includes a simple QA script that runs after the scraper finishes.
  
### 🔄 Workflow  

1. Start at the base URL.  
2. Authenticate using provided credentials.  
3. Parse each page for quotes.  
4. Append the quotes to a JSON file, grouped by page.  
5. Navigate to the next page and repeat until completion.  
6. Log each step for transparency and debugging.

## 2. 🚀 Considerations and improvements to ensure scalability, proper maintenance and data security
  
### 🔄 Parallelism  
  
- **Current**: Sequential scraping (single-threaded)  
- **Future**: Add `asyncio`, `threading`, or task queues (e.g., `Celery`)  
  
### 🗃️ Data Storage  
  
- **Current**: Flat JSON file  
- **Future**: Use PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or streaming to AWS S3/BigQuery  
  
### 📦 Distributed Scraping  
  
- Use Docker and Kubernetes  
- Split page ranges across multiple workers  
  
### 🌐 IP Rotation and Rate Limits  
  
- Add proxy rotation and dynamic throttling  
- Use services like ScraperAPI, BrightData, or Tor for obfuscation  
  
### 🔍 Monitoring  
  
- Use an already implemented monitoring solution like Sentry, Prometheus/Grafana or the ones provided by AWS, GCP and Azure
- Track key metrics: scrape rate, error rate, data volume, success/fail ratio.
- Centralize all monitoring and observability in a dashboard

### 🔐 Config & Secrets Management

- Never hardcode API keys, credentials, or database passwords.
- Store credentials and configurations/constants securely using environment variables, .env files, or cloud secrets managers (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault)

### 👥 Network Security And Permissions

- Use TLS/SSL for all data transfers (HTTPS endpoints, SFTP).
- Use principle of least privilege — only necessary services or users get access.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for databases and infrastructure.

### 🧪 Testing

- Add Unit and Integration tests using libraries `unittest` or `pytest`, and measure code coverage with coverage.py
- Use snapshot testing to detect DOM or structure changes.
- Use `black`, `flake8`, or `isort` to enforce consistent and correct code style.

### 🧭 Versioning & Backups

- Version scraped data against versioned scrapers.

### 🧹 Anti-Scraping & Ethical Concerns

- Respect robots.txt and site terms of service.
- Mimic human behavior if needed: random delays, browser headers, etc.
- Consider headless browsers (e.g., Puppeteer, Playwright) for JS-heavy sites.
- Verify that scraping complies with data protection regulations.
- Implement mechanisms to detect scraped user profiles, emails, financial information or other sensitive data and obfuscate it.
- Define clear data retention periods. Implement automated deletion pipelines or tools.

### 📋 Documentation & Policies

- Maintain a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) if scraping on behalf of clients.

## 3. 🌟 Enhancements I would do with more time, in no specific order.
  
- Use `argparse` CLI for flexible inputs (URL, file name, creds) 
- Retry queues
- Replace occurrences of sys.exit() with a custom exceptions
- Implement User-Agent Rotation & Headers. The code is always using the default `requests` module User-Agent, it should add support for rotating UAs and Accept-Language and Referer headers
- When a page fails parsing, save it to disk in order to debug failures later.
- Switch to use libraries like `retrying` or `retry2` to implement retrying logic
- In addition to the existing data QA script, switch to a modern Python build system like `Poetry` or `uv` for dependency and environment management, implement the testing outlined in the 🧪 Testing section, and enforce passing tests via pre-commit hooks and/or as a requirement for merging PRs. Also, implement the resource and time improvements discussed in the 🔄 Parallelism section.

## 4. ✅ Summary  
  
This scraper is modular, tested, and works reliably on smaller datasets. With architectural improvements—parallelism, database integration, and distributed execution—it can scale to millions of pages efficiently.
